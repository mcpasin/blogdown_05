I am Product Data Analyst at ..., a network of online trading platforms where
people can buy and sell everything. 

My interest include data science, visualizations and web analytics. When it comes to programming I mostly code with R.

This is my personal site where I post about data analysis. You can also find some of 
my previous projects under the Portfolio section. I am also the founder of [analyticsforfun.com](http://www.analyticsforfun.com/), a blog mostly focused on web analytics.
 

Feel fre to connect  and contact me for any professional collaboration.
