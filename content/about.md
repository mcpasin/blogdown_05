I am currently working as Product  Data Analyst at ..., a network of online trading platforms where
people can buy and sell everything. 

My interest include web analytics, data visualizations and more recently data science. I mostly code with **R**, do a lot of **SQL** for data extraction and enjoy making it prettier with **Tableau**.

This is my personal site where I post about data analysis. You can also find some of 
my previous projects under the Portfolio section. I am also the founder of [analyticsforfun.com](http://www.analyticsforfun.com/), a blog mostly focused on web analytics.

This site is made with R and the super cool blogdown package. So, expect as much code :computer: and data :bar_chart: as words :clipboard: .
 

Last but not least, feel free to connect or contact me for any professional collaboration :smiley: :hand: .
