I am currently working as **Product Data Analyst** at OLX Group, a network of online trading platforms where
people can buy and sell everything. 

My interest include web analytics, data visualizations and more recently data science. I mostly code with **R** for the full data analysis workflow, do a lot of **SQL** for data extraction and enjoy making results prettier with **Tableau**.

This is my personal site where I post about data analysis. You can also find some of 
my previous projects under the Portfolio section. I've also launched [analyticsforfun.com](http://www.analyticsforfun.com/), a blog mostly focused on web analytics.

This site is made with R and the super cool _blogdown_ package. So, expect as much code and data :computer: :bar_chart: as words :clipboard: .
 

Last but not least, feel free to connect for any professional collaboration or just to say Hi!  :hand: :smiley:
